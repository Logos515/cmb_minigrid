# Implementation Log

## Step 0 — project scaffold and contracts

### Implemented

- Added an editable Python package with runtime/configuration helpers.
- Added YAML presets for the shared runtime, RSSM-A/B dimensions, and CMB
  capacity.
- Added `AgentObs`, `Trajectory`, and `RSSMState` validation contracts.
- Added seed management, deterministic PyTorch settings, device selection,
  stable experiment IDs, and run-directory creation.
- Added package directories for environments, models, bridge, data, trainers,
  evaluation, scripts, and tests.
- Added `docs/spec.md` with the frozen time-index, observation, state, split,
  and no-leakage rules.

### Verified

- Environment used: conda environment `cmb_minigrid`, Python 3.11.17,
  PyTorch 2.14.1+cu130, NumPy 2.4.6, PyYAML 6.0.3, Gymnasium 1.4.0,
  MiniGrid 3.1.0, pytest 9.1.1.
- Editable installation succeeded with
  `/data2/xuyihao/envs/cmb_minigrid/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'`
  (project installed as `cmb-minigrid 0.1.0`).
- `/data2/xuyihao/envs/cmb_minigrid/bin/python -m pytest -q` — **7 passed**.
- `/data2/xuyihao/envs/cmb_minigrid/bin/python -m cmb_minigrid.cli --help` —
  exit code 0; help includes config, seed, device, output directory, and
  experiment name options.
- `/data2/xuyihao/envs/cmb_minigrid/bin/python -m cmb_minigrid.cli --config
  configs/default.yaml --seed 42 --device cpu --output-dir
  /tmp/cmb_minigrid_runs` — exit code 0; produced experiment ID
  `cmb_minigrid_step0-aa46e782ff` and created its log directory.
- Invalid config path smoke — exit code 2 with readable message
  `configuration file does not exist: /does/not/exist.yaml`.
- `ruff check cmb_minigrid tests` — clean after applying its four typing
  modernization suggestions.

### Not implemented / not tested yet

- No MiniGrid environment factory or rollout (Step 1).
- No HiddenHistoryNav/counterfactual pair generator (Step 2).
- No trajectory dataset, RSSM, policy, bridge, or training code (Steps 3–8).
- No closed-loop evaluation or experiment results (Steps 9–10).
- No training, environment rollout, or data generation commands were run,
  because those belong to later steps.

### Step 1 dependencies

The named `cmb_minigrid` environment now has the package and Step 1 dependencies
installed. Start Step 1 by implementing the MiniGrid-Memory factory and
observation/action adapter only. Preserve the contracts in `docs/spec.md`; in
particular, do not add hidden labels or global maps to `AgentObs`, and keep the
no-double-fusion handoff convention. Confirm MiniGrid 3.1.0 action semantics
before restricting the public interface to left/right/forward.
